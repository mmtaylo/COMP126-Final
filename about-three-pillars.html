            <p class="center-header">As a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma, we strive to fulfill our national purposes and mission statement. However, a single statement of our purposes cannot begin to explain what Iota Lambda means to each of its members. Our chapter focuses on three main pillars which guide our chapter’s goals and events: service, sisterhood, and leadership, which are discussed below in detail.</p>

                    <p class="about-three-pillars-section-body">We proudly serve the UNC Music Department, and the Chapel Hill community. Music and marching band have given us so much throughout our lives, and we want to express our appreciation by giving back as much as we possibly can. On a normal week, this includes setting up and breaking down the field for rehearsal, preparing the band section of Kenan Stadium for football games, and being ready to assist our band director, Jeff Fuchs. In addition to our regular service we also organize special events, like marching band uniform distribution and leading music workshops for Girl Scouts troops. </p>

                    <p class="about-three-pillars-section-body">In addition to being a service organization, Tau Beta Sigma is a coed sorority that emphasizes sisterhood. As a smaller chapter, Iota Lambda is especially tight-knit. In this chapter our members have found friendship, respect, and a support system that celebrates the good times and encourages during tough times. We are especially committed to promoting equality and diversity in our chapter. There is no "typical" sister or brother of Iota Lambda; we have a diverse group of personalities and backgrounds, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

                    <p class="about-three-pillars-section-body">Furthermore, we love connecting with other chapters of Tau Beta Sigma. At each football game, we visit the opposing team's marching band to meet and socialize with their chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. Inter-chapter sisterhood is extremely valuable in appreciating the national impact of our service.  Many members of Iota Lambda are great friends with sisters of other chapters, and we try to organize get-togethers as often as possible!</p>

                    <p class="about-three-pillars-section-body">Our last tenant is leadership. Members often experience huge growth in leadership during their time in Tau Beta Sigma.  Even after the process of candidacy, our growth is not over; most members have had to step significantly outside of their comfort zone at some point, whether it be to organize a fundraiser, lead a service event, or take the initiative to reach out to music department faculty members.  Iota Lambda is small enough that most members hold leadership positions within the chapter, which means that each member plays a huge role in enabling us to thrive. </p>

                    <p class="about-three-pillars-section-body">Service and leadership in the marching band are often intertwined; Tau Beta Sigma helps wherever possible in making sure the band runs smoothly. This means being punctual and prepared for rehearsals and performances, and leading by example in our respective sections. Members of Iota Lambda have been section captains, office assistants, pep band conductors, pep band coordinators, and drum majors. </p>
